## What should I download?
If you're using a PC with Windows / Linux, or Intel Macs, use AMD64

If you're using a Mac from mid-2021, use AArch64

## Should I use it?
No, yet. Since this is a whole new OS nothing will support this.

However, if you have the knowledge to develop apps, you might be able to make them.
